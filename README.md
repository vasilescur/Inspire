# Inspire
Idea-sharing website. Powered by PHP and MySQL.

I made this as a project at a 3-week intensive IT program called DITLE at the University of Cincinnati. While building this project, I learned how to use PHP to connect a website to a database, and how to use MySQL.


## [Static Demo](https://vasilescur.github.io/Inspire/)
Unfortunately, GH Pages doesn't support server-side scripting, so I can't host a live demo. However, I've put up the site as-is, to showcase the GUI at least. If you try to use the post or search functionalities, you'll just hit an HTTP 405 - Not Allowed.

## [Project Description](https://vasilescur.github.io/Inspire/Inspire.pdf)
A PDF of a PowerPoint used to present this project. Outlines basic functionality and development process.
